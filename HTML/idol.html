    <h2>Early Life & Education</h2>
    <p>Eaindra Kyaw Zin was born to a well-to-do family in Yangon, the youngest child of Mya Thida and Kyaw Zin. She is
        a granddaughter of Bo Zeya, one of the Thirty Comrades that founded the modern Burmese Army, a niece of Dagon
        Taya, a writer, and a first cousin of singer Hayma Ne Win and singer and film star Yaza Ne Win. Kyaw Zin
        graduated from Yangon's Dagon 1 High School. She holds a B.Sc. degree in chemistry.[2]</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Carrer</h2>
    <p>In an interview with The Myanmar Times, Kyaw Zin admitted that film was not her initial choice of a career.
        Rather she envisioned herself as an independent artist or a doctor but had to reevaluate her options after
        getting sub-par grades in school. Her first foray into the entertainment industry came by way of a local beauty
        contest. She won the Miss Kokkine contest in 1996, and then went on to win Miss Christmas that same year. After
        this year, she became to act in TV series such as Loving Editor (Chit Thaw Editor) and Ah Hnine Mae. She became
        popular in Ah Hnine Mae TV series with a character called Po Tay. For the next two years she appeared in
        magazines and modeling shows. In 2000, she scored her big break as an actress in the film Pyaw Lai Kya Ya Aung
        (Let's Have Great Fun) as the lead actress.[1] She was nominated as best lead actress at Tha-Mee-Shin Film for
        2000 Academy.

        Ironically, her film career in the early 2000s was handicapped by the top leading man of that day, Yaza Ne Win,
        her first cousin. In 2003, she spoke to Chiangmai-based The Irrawaddy magazine that "I have limited
        opportunities to act in current popular movies. In the movies, I can only perform sibling roles with my first
        cousin and we can not shoot love scenes." As it is leading men who score big at the box office in Burma, and
        being cast aside male superstars is an actress's best chance at fame.[3]

        Eaindra Kyaw Zin won the 2004 Myanmar Academy Award, playing a villain role in the movie, Flirtatious Sky
        (မျက်နှာများတဲ့ကောင်းကင်). She continues to act in films and model for commercials. Eaindra Kyaw Zin also won
        the 2017 Myanmar Academy Award, playing in the main role in the movie, Knife in the Heart (
        Yin-Bat-Htae-Ka-Dar). Although she is over 40, she is still a top model and actress in an industry full of young
        starlets. She is also vice-CEO of Pyay Ti Oo Education Foundation and, Chair-Person of Thudra Film Production
        and The Bridge Myanmar.</p>
